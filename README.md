# marko
A dumb marks organiser for your academics!

# Marko in action
![Settings Window](https://raw.github.com/ayush7788/marko/main/marko_in_action.png)

Ever forgot your marks in tests you got? If yes then "Marks Organiser" is here to help!
And yeah it is dumb as it sounds!üòÅ
# Usage
Marko works something similar to how git works.
First you have to initialise an empty directory with command -
```
marko init
```
When the directory is initialised a ".marko_init" file is generated in given directory, containing current directory name and some other information.
Then you have to commit a file(usually name of your exam) as -
```
marko commit Finals
```
It will generate a file called "Finals" in the directory.
Then to start registering your marks in this file do -
```
marko set Finals
```
It will set default storage file to "Finals"
Then to register marks -
```
marko push Maths 80
```
It will register your marks in "Maths" as "80".
Wow how dumb!! Gimme an award for this!!

If you ever needed some help -
```
marko help
```

```
